Check out site CleverLayover.com to figure out whether a layover may be right for you, he writes. </p> <p> <strong>Combine discount airfares.</strong> </p> <p>Eric Urbain, the North American general manager of <a href=\"http://www.liligo.com\" target=\"_new\" class=\"icon \">travel search site liligo.com</a> says that you can sometimes save up to 70% off airfare \u201cby booking two one-way tickets with two different low cost airlines like Spirit or Frontier.\u201d </p> <p> <strong>Look at nearby cities. </strong> </p> <p>Consider booking a cheap flight to another, nearby city and then continuing your trip to the city you\u2019re going to via another airline or train,\u201d says Reddi. \u201cFor long-distance flights, build your own itinerary by combining a super-cheap long haul that gets you to the region you want to go with a low-cost regional airline that won\u2019t show up on international flight scanners,\u201d explains <a href=\"http://www.marathon-studios.com/\" target=\"_new\" class=\"icon \">tech consultant</a> and frequent traveler Jonathan Weber. \u201cFor instance, it\u2019s easy to get sub-$400 flights from East Coast U.S.A. to Norway with Norwegian Airlines. Combine this with a $50 euro Ryanair flight, and you can get to London, Paris, or just about anywhere in Europe for less than half of what most people pay for the cheapest direct flight.\u201d </p> <p> <strong>Don\u2019t forget about the fees. </strong> </p> <p>While it\u2019s tempting to book just based on ticket price, that can be a big mistake: Low-cost airfare isn\u2019t always the best option,\u201d says Urbain. If you\u2019re checking bags, consider baggage fees. It\u2019s also worth going on airline sites to see what other fees they will charge before booking. </p> <p> <strong>Consider booking directly with the airline. </strong> </p> <p>Many airlines are <a href=\"/story/youre-booking-your-flights-all-wrong-2015-07-21\" class=\"icon none\">now offering deals and discount codes on their own websites </a>that aren\u2019t available on the online travel deal aggregators. So while experts say you should still check online travel sites for deals, don\u2019t forget to check an airline\u2019s site too. </p> <p> <strong>Book early.</strong> </p> <p>\u201cFor domestic tickets, book three months in advance. International tickets should be booked six months before the dates of travel. Prices gradually increase as the departure date approaches, so do it ASAP,\u201d says Urbain. </p> <p class=\"editorcomment\">You\u2019re invited:</p> <p class=\"editorcomment\">If you\u2019ll be in the San Francisco Bay Area at the end of July, we\u2019d like you to join us for a special event focusing on retirement issues for women.

And one of the things I preach is that unfocused enthusiasm\u00a0and fancy jargon\u00a0<em>do not</em> make a sale. Customers are counting on us at dealerships to guide them to the best car for them, not be convinced to buy something they don\u2019t need.</p>\n<p>Recently, a computing solutions company\u00a0performed a <a href=\"http://www.cdkglobal.com/InsightCenter\">thorough analysis of email responses</a> from car dealerships to determine what words and phrases led most often to closes on car sales.

Car shoppers need to be guided through the process and the research supported using language to help them on their journey.\u201d</p>\n<p>The bottom line is that salespeople need to provide\u00a0concrete information made understandable to the average shopper, and to set up specific times to follow-up with the customer to lead them to the next steps in the buying process.</p>\n<p>By knowing your audience and using the best communication to reach them, you\u2019re far more likely to sell effectively.

Crash data indicates areas with July 4 celebrations pose an increased risk when people make the decision to get behind the wheel while impaired.\u201d</p>\n<p>So if you are cruising on a remote country road at Lake Texoma this holiday weekend, and you encounter an ENDUI sobriety check point or saturation patrol, it is not a coincidence.</p>\n<p><img pid=\"0\" src=\"//s3.amazonaws.com//blog.newsok/blogs_content/endui-summer-enforcement_block_1.png\"/></p>\n<p>The Oklahoma Highway Safety Office and the <a href=\"http://bit.ly/1FFIhzD\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">ENDUI</a> Statewide Impaired Driving Enforcement Teams are using state-of-the-art technology and \u201cheat maps\u201d to plan their enforcement efforts.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t just throw darts at the board and decided that\u2019s where we are going,\u201d said Chris Rogers, Department of Public Safety a traffic enforcement planner for the state Public Safety Department. Rogers designs data and technology solutions for the highway patrol, the Oklahoma Highway Safety Office and the Oklahoma Department of Public Safety.</p>\n<p>The technology brings traffic collision data from virtually every Oklahoma law enforcement agency together in a single database.</p>\n<p>The state began creating a shared technology solution based on ESRI mapping and Micro Strategies business intelligence software and data analytics tools to provide an educated enforcement model for all of Oklahoma.</p>\n<p>\u201cThrough detailed data collection and evaluation, the Department of Public Safety is now able to pinpoint problem areas where either traffic crashes occur with above average probability (or) where impaired driving occurs more frequently than in other places,\u201d \u00a0said Captain Hampton, of the Futures, Capabilities and Plans Division of the Oklahoma Department of Public Safety . \u00a0\u201cIt even takes into consideration areas where underage drinking occurs or patrons are often overserved. By pushing this data through a series of filters, law enforcement is able to create \u2018heat maps\u2019 to provide precision policing in areas that need it most.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>In an age of big data and digital technology, Oklahoma lacked the ability to coordinate collision data in a useful way. Until recently, there was no unified system, and law enforcement agencies across the state used different processes. <strong><em>\u00a0</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em><figure class=\"inlinephoto none\">\n  <span class=\"hmedia\">\n      <img src=\"http://cdn2.newsok.biz/cache/w620-76700f08d415c3db858ead894b90c391.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"/>\n  </span>\n</figure></em></strong></p>\n<p>Also, collision data was only available several months after the incident occurred and the data tools available to OHP commanders was limited to broad time frames. Now the Department of Public Safety can quickly consume the electronic data and provide law enforcement decision makers with time and place crash data, which allows for focused efforts in a precise location at a precise time, Rogers said.</p>\n<p>The data also helps design strategies to keep impaired drivers off the roads in the first place. When planning statewide efforts, officers can look at data for holidays. ENDUI teams work with local partners to learn about major events in the area. Planners then use data to see if those dates and time frames show repeating behavior. This information is provided to the ENDUI teams, who then begin educational campaigns and enforcement, Rogers said.</p>\n<p>The Fourth of July holiday is a dangerous holiday on Oklahoma\u2019s roads, and impaired driving plays a major role in that.\u00a0 In 2014, five of the 11 road fatalities that occurred during the holiday weekend were drug- or alcohol-related. In 2015, three of the 12 fatalities were drug- or alcohol-related.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s why this Fourth of July, ENDUI Statewide Impaired Driving Enforcement Teams conduct high visibility enforcement statewide, including checkpoints and saturation patrols around lakes, festivals, and other areas of concern. \u00a0In addition, Oklahoma Highway Safety Office is partnering with the Oklahoma Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services to keep the holiday weekend safe for all Oklahomans. OHSO is funding overtime enforcement efforts statewide to target alcohol violations as part of the ENDUI effort. The 2Much2Lose Task Force works with local municipalities to combat underage drinking, enforce social host laws, and related prevention efforts. \u00a0</p>\n<p><img pid=\"0\" src=\"//s3.amazonaws.com//blog.newsok/blogs_content/endui-summer-enforcement_block_2.png\"/></p>\n<h2><strong>A closer look at some of Oklahoma\u2019s Fourth of July hot spots</strong></h2>\n<p><strong>Lake Texoma</strong></p>\n<p><strong><figure class=\"inlinephoto none\">\n  <span class=\"hmedia\">\n      <img src=\"http://cdn2.newsok.biz/cache/w620-5fbe45d49efe4ef2c81b0b1e1082760f.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"/>\n  </span>\n</figure></strong></p>\n<p>During the holiday weekend, many Oklahomans migrate toward the lake regions for some fun in the sun. However, throughout the years, that has made some lakes pop up on the ENDUI heat maps as problem areas, including Lake Texoma.</p>\n<p>When data indicates hot spots on rural lake access areas during holiday periods, local law enforcement in the area join the ENDUI Statewide Impaired Driving Enforcement Team to help understand where impaired driving crashes are most likely to occur, Hampton said.\u00a0 For example, from four major boat ramps on a large Oklahoma lake, one county road may be the only outbound exit lake-goers use after a day of drinking. This leads to deadly mix of impaired drivers and congested county roads.</p>\n<p><strong>OKC and Tulsa Metro Areas</strong></p>\n<p><strong><img pid=\"0\" src=\"//s3.amazonaws.com//blog.newsok/blogs_content/heat%20map%20metros.png\"/></strong></p>\n<h6>Image depicts hot spots around Oklahoma's two major metros based on 2015 data. Source: Oklahoma Highway Safety Office.</h6>\n<p>During the Fourth of July weekend, the metro areas host several major holiday celebrations and festivals, and the entertainment districts will be hopping. In addition, major highways intersect in Oklahoma City and Tulsa, meaning that a majority of holiday travelers may pass through the cities at some point or another.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe OKC and Tulsa metro areas provide options for those who don\u2019t necessarily want to travel to eastern and southern Oklahoma for a long holiday weekend. By the shear population base and licensed establishments in each of these areas, Oklahoma City and Tulsa have their own impaired driving issues. Law enforcement planners use historical data and precision policing for education and enforcement activities in both metro areas, Hampton said.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cThe use of heat maps for the location and analytical tools to determine when an impaired driving collision is likely to occur allows for intelligent deployment of law enforcement resources to try and prevent a tragedy versus responding to one,\u201d Hampton said. \u00a0</p>\n<p>He added that when good people make bad decisions, law enforcement wants to have resources there to prevent a tragedy.</p>\n<p>Find results from ENDUI enforcement teams at <a href=\"http://bit.ly/1FFIhzD\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.enduiok.com</a> at the Sobriety Checkpoint Finder.

By increasing the perceived risk of arrest, this application assists in deterring those who would decide to drive under the influence, whereby reducing the numbers of serious injury and fatality collisions on Oklahoma\u2019s highways, ENDUI officials said.</p>\n<p><em>This story is sponsored by the Oklahoma Highway Safety Office.</em></p>\n\n                    </div>\n        \n\n        \n        \n        <p class=\"footnote\">NewsOK BrandInsight provides a place for local organizations and companies to connect directly with the NewsOK audience by publishing articles of interest on the NewsOK digital platforms in a special section.</p>\n\n\n        \n        \n        \n                </div></body></html>", "description": "The state began creating a shared technology solution based on ESRI mapping and Micro Strategies <b>business intelligence</b> software and data&nbsp;...", "title": "Oklahoma metro areas and lakes are &#39;hot spots&#39; on ENDUI heat mapping technology this Fourth of ...", "link": "http://newsok.com/article/5506951", "published": "2016-06-29T05:03:31Z", "article_content_goose": 6790}

{"article_content_readability": "<html><body><div><div class=\"ContentEditor\"><p>Recruiters in Scotland will be waiting anxiously to hear the outcome of First Minister Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s meeting with European Parliament President Martin Shulz in Brussels today (Wed 29 June) as the SNP leader bids to protect the country\u2019s place in Europe despite the UK\u2019s Brexit decision.</p> <p>The recruitment industry over the border is grappling with various slippery issues, from a lethargic candidate base with unrealistic pay expectations to a shrinking skills pool that obliges some to deploy staff abroad, where the talent is located, and then redirect it to Scotland.\u00a0</p> <p>Scottish recruiters are anxious about what appears to be a lack of urgency from Whitehall in implementing a timetable of change since David Cameron\u2019s decision to step down but also quiet optimism that red tape, which has often hampered the industry, will be shredded. Overall, though, the message is of quiet confidence that the recruitment sector is resilient enough to thrive.</p> <p>Martin McCrum, managing director at Aspirare, is optimistic for the industry, but believes some endemic problems relating to Scotland\u2019s economy need to be addressed.</p> <p>\u201cLeaving some of these unworkable EU directives behind will present us with good opportunities and we need a strong voice based here in the UK to be heard but until someone comes up with a plan to move on [post-Brexit], we will have no clarity,\u201d said McCrum. \u201cBut we\u2019ll survive because we\u2019re the fifth biggest economic power in the world and business will go on.\u201d</p> <p>Although the UK voted by 52% to 48% to leave the trading bloc, those North of the border voted by to remain by 62%, suggesting once again that it may seek independence.</p> <p>Aspirare places permanent and contract workers in engineering, construction, administration, IT, sales, and accountancy &amp; finance sectors.</p> <p>\u201cBefore the referendum there was an apathy in the Scottish labour market and there still is to a certain extent when it comes to candidates taking certain roles. That mindset will prevail unfortunately,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think the appetite is there to take up some of the jobs we have available in Scotland even now. For example, we\u2019ve been trying to fill a contract position for electricians at \u00a316 an hour. That\u2019s not enough for some people. They\u2019d rather wait for something better but they will find it\u2019s a false economy. However, if I get a Polish electrician with all the right certification and the right attitude, he would happily work for that rate. The client, however, is working to a budget and candidates need to understand that.</p> <p>\u201cThe economy is measured in terms of jobs and we\u2019re a barometer for this. The politicians won\u2019t be able to hide any more and, if some form of constitutional change is the result of all of this, it may be just what is needed,\u201d added McCrum.</p> <p>In these early days since the referendum no one is sure just yet what will happen, and so cautious employers are beginning to claw back on plans to recruit \u2013 and there are fears of budgets being put on ice completely. On the other hand, restrictions on immigration, which underpinned the Leave campaign, and the uncertainty of what happens next to the economy could potentially increase the demand for contractors and temporary workers during the current void.</p> <p>Earlier this week, Andrew Speers, chief executive of specialist oil &amp; gas recruiter Petroplan, told <em>Recruiter</em>: \u201cAn area of particular interest for us will be the longer-term future of the UK in its current form. Scotland is a hub of the oil &amp; gas sector, with many workers in the sector employed in Scotland or off its shore, so Scottish independence could certainly have an impact on the future of oil &amp; gas recruitment.\u201d</p> <p>Contract Scotland, which supplies temporary and permanent staff to the wider construction industry from site administrator to director level, acknowledges that a period of uncertainty will prevail but, once again, a lot has yet to be clarified.</p> <p>John-Paul Toner, operations director, said: \u201cI don\u2019t think our perspective is too different from the rest of the UK in terms of the result. It was something of a surprise and not what we hoped for but it\u2019s still too early to say what is going to happen.\u00a0</p> <p>\u201cThe construction industry has been suffering from a skill shortage from well before the referendum and this result can only add to this.\u201d</p> <p>The company currently has a consultant based in Spain whose job it is to identify talent and direct it to Scotland. Initiatives like this, though, will be difficult to maintain unless freedom of movement is protected in a post-Brexit UK.</p> <p>\u201cThe industry needs to protect free movement of labour and needed talent somehow. While we remain in Europe, we are able to continue operating that model. There are so many variables to consider before we start to say with any certainty how competition for that increasingly decreasing talent pool will play out,\u201d said Toner.</p> <p>\u201cBusiness dislikes uncertainty but we need to know a little more before can move on.</p> <p>\u201cWe will work through this uncertainty and react accordingly when new political leaders are in place and when we know what the Brexit decision really means for our industry,\u201d he added.</p> <ul>     <li> <em>Want to comment on this story?

{"article_content_readability": "<html><body><div><td valign=\"top\">&#13;\n                &#13;\n                &#13;\n                <p>According to Forrester\u2019s \u201cCustomer Lifecycle Journey,\u201d there has been an 81 percent increase in customer use of online forums and communities for self-help, which corroborates the Edelman Trust Barometer\u2019s findings that 63 percent of global consumers say they trust \u201ca person like yourself\u201d more than a company employee (52 percent) or company CEO (49 percent). With all this strong support from customers for online communities, it\u2019s important that organizations get their customer engagement right from day one.</p><p>One of the biggest dangers in building a successful customer community is not engaging new customers within the first days, weeks, and early months. The risk is that once a customer becomes inactive or never engages in the first place, it is almost impossible to get them re-engaged. It can be a pressure-filled task\u2014we spend so much time planning how to <em>win</em> new customers, but do we spend enough time thinking about how to <em>keep</em> them once they arrive? This is where an online community can be a critical component for any new customer on-boarding program.</p><h4>Personalization</h4><p>New customers are joining your online community, and they need to get engaged right away. You should encourage interactions immediately in order to ensure customers stay interested, connected, and engaged long-term. But also make sure your interactions with new customers are balanced\u2014too much outreach can scare or overwhelm someone new, while not enough fails to capture their interest or help them see the value in your customer community.</p><p>First create a new customer campaign that includes personalized calls to action (CTAs) to engage customers. According to a HubSpot study of 93,000 CTAs, personalized CTAs convert 42 percent better. So you\u2019re halfway there with personalization. But let\u2019s be honest: You want to be personal without infringing on your customers\u2019 privacy or time. You need to keep them engaged without crossing the line<strong>.\u00a0</strong>Encourage engagement with the very first CTAs\u2014when a new customer joins, send a personalized note with details on an interesting community discussion they should join, based off of their interests. If they join a discussion early on, they will become more invested in what the community has to offer. You can also reach out and share a list of people they may know who are already participating in the community, with links to connect. These outreach tactics focus on interaction, not just static content or signing up for something. It\u2019s easy to cross the line with repetitive requests to download a new article, or successive emails asking to sign up for a newsletter over and over.</p>&#13;\n                &#13;\n<p id=\"div-gpt-ad-1385150695079-8\">&#13;\n&#13;\n</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n                <h4>Balance Is Key</h4><p>Now that you\u2019ve personalized your message, let\u2019s keep balance in mind. It\u2019s pivotal to carefully adjust parameters for your audience segments, making sure they\u2019re as specific as possible. It boils down to gathering the right information in advance. Go beyond, \u201cDo you want to receive emails? If so, check this box.\u201d Asking them for detailed feedback on how they want to interact with you will signal to them that you are a thoughtful contact.</p><p>So be sure you\u2019re gathering the right data through your automated campaigns, and present multiple ways for your customers to interact with you, based on their own desires. You\u2019ve heard it before but it resonates here: It\u2019s about getting the right message to the right person at the right time.</p><p>Implementing automated campaigns early can have two-pronged success: You gather data about what your customers want and need, and your customers have timely opportunities to engage and see what interests them. Integrating this type of automation with an online community means you can put that useful data to work and offer an authentic engagement space for your customers.</p><p>Why is it worth the effort? Because engaged customers refer new customers, provide you with ongoing valuable feedback, and spend more! A large professional association found that its most engaged community members were 30 percent more likely to refer a friend or colleague and spent five times the amount of money as disengaged members. Most of the organization\u2019s new customer campaigns had conversion rates between 25 and 45 percent. Those are numbers any marketing professional would love.</p><p>These campaigns included simple calls to action (log in, update your profile, post a discussion in the community, etc.) that helped customers over barriers to entry and made them much more likely to participate more in that community, and move through what we call a Customer Lifecycle Curve.</p><p>A colleague recently shared a frustrating story about her experience after purchasing a business intelligence (BI) tool for their business analyst. Business intelligence is a key part of her daily job, and it\u2019s complex, as it integrates with their CRM and accounting platform. The on-boarding process was a day of free training, PDF training documents, and contact information for an account manager if she had issues. That was a great start but it ended there. She spent the next three months trying to figure it all out herself until the company ended up hiring a consultant. Having access to a network of similar customers also integrating it with Salesforce and NetSuite would have been a great resource. And providing ways to have her engage directly with this group would have been invaluable to everyone involved. Opportunity lost.</p><h4>Moving On Up</h4><p>Now think about the long-term picture: the life of your relationship with your customer. Engagement early on is key to a good long-term relationship, but there are also ways to expect and plan for activity going forward, if you\u2019re paying attention. This is where the concept of a Customer Lifecycle Curve is helpful. It offers a complete customer experience, as well as direction for how any organization can optimize those individual experiences every step of the way.</p><hr/><p><em>Rob\u00a0Wenger is CEO of Higher Logic.

{"article_content_readability": "<html><body><div><div id=\"theArticle\">\n                <p>The use of business intelligence is now widespread in many areas of corporate life. A marketing team will use information such as click-through rates to gauge the success or otherwise of campaigns, while sales teams can assess the impact of individual people or promotions on takings.</p>\n<p>The legal sector, though, has been slow to make use of this kind of information. Yet the capability to do this exists, particularly in the area of eDisclosure. Adi Elliott, vice president, market planning, at Epiq Systems, gives the example of a corporation using an in-house legal team or hiring a law firm to help with its litigation, and deploying the services of an external organisation to assist with the data and process management.</p>\n<p>\u201cPart of the disclosure process is to figure out how to limit the corporation\u2019s data to certain people within particular periods of time so legal teams can look at those documents and decide if they are relevant or privileged, before being given to the other side,\u201d he says. \u201cCurrently each one of those projects is treated as a separate and distinct task, even though a corporation might be involved in very similar projects hundreds of times a year.\u201d</p>\n<p>There are often good reasons for this, he adds, including the fact that different people from the client organisation or law firm may work on particular cases, but the end result is that businesses are unable to identify any trends across cases or compare the services and efficiency of different providers.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf a business is sued 20 times a year around labour and employment issues, it will benefit from knowing what the wider trends are,\u201d says Mr Elliott. \u201cIt needs to know which organisations these claims regularly come from, how many people are typically involved and how many documents they typically have to give to the other side.</p>\n<p class=\"embedded_related_articles\"><strong>Related Articles:</strong><br/><a href=\"http://raconteur.net/business/essential-tool-in-age-of-big-data\" class=\"track_this\" data-track-id=\"article_embedded_related_links\">Essential tool in age of big data</a><br/><a href=\"http://raconteur.net/business/a-birds-eye-view-of-risk\" class=\"track_this\" data-track-id=\"article_embedded_related_links\">A bird's eye view of risk</a><br/><a href=\"http://raconteur.net/technology/how-services-organisations-can-drive-success-in-a-data-driven-world\" class=\"track_this\" data-track-id=\"article_embedded_related_links\">How services organisations can drive success in a data-driven world </a><br/></p>\n<p>\u201cIt might hire three different law firms to represent it across 20 different cases, so which one is the most efficient with that data? Which collects the least data and which has the highest responsiveness rate in terms of that data being relevant?\u201d</p>\n<p>Having this kind of information can help identify the most efficient and cost-effective law firms, he says, as well as help organisations get a better idea of how much such cases should cost them, and identify any potential underlying issues in the business which could reduce the number of cases in the first place.</p>\n<blockquote><span>We\u2019re the first organisation that is really injecting business intelligence into eDisclosure, but we want to promote this because it\u2019s a valuable process</span></blockquote>\n<p>Using a system such as Epiq Systems\u2019 eDisclosure dashboard DMX gives organisations the power to draw much greater insight, both within individual cases and more generally. \u201cIt allows you to collect the data and normalise the spreadsheets, PowerPoints and pdfs, and make it into one cohesive package that a lawyer can make sense of,\u201d says Mr Elliott.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can start with what you handed over to the other side and see trends within the case, backwards and forward, which is not usually possible. But the real potential is in picking up trends across cases so you can be more accurate with your budget and make strategic changes to be more efficient.\u201d</p>\n<p>Currently, the legal sector is right at the beginning of deploying such innovation, says Mr Elliott, but he believes deployment will pick up pace once awareness of the potential of eDisclosure gets out. \u201cIt takes a really specific series of skillsets to do this and you have to have a few pieces in place to properly solve this problem,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re the first organisation that is really injecting business intelligence into eDisclosure, but we want to promote this because it\u2019s a valuable process.\u201d</p>\n<p>In the longer term, Mr Elliott believes this kind of process will become standard practice for legal teams, in the same way that business intelligence is used by other parts of organisations. \u201cNo marketing person today would advertise for a campaign and not want to see A/B testing and click-through rates, or to create three different campaigns that are all radically different and not want to know which one is best,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s like oxygen for businesspeople and this will be the same for eDisclosure too.\u201d</p>\n<p>For more information about how Epiq Systems can help your business, visit <a href=\"http://www.epiqsystems.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\">www.epiqsystems.co.uk</a></p>\n            </div>\n            </div></body></html>", "description": "The use of <b>business intelligence</b> is now widespread in many areas of corporate life.

Ahead of an election year in 2017, Marine Le Pen of France\u2019s far-right National Front stated that the Brexit vote was a \u201cvictory for liberty\u201d. She promised immediate negotiations regarding the country\u2019s EU membership terms, and an in-out referendum within six months if her party wins the election.</span></span></p>&#13;\n<p><span><span>Similarly, far-right and anti-immigration parties in several other EU member countries \u2013 including in the Netherlands, Austria, Italy, Denmark, Sweden, and Hungary \u2013 have called for opportunities to renegotiate membership or hold their own votes on remaining in the EU.</span></span></p>&#13;\n<p><span><span>While the UK may be an outlier in terms of its historically strained relationship with the EU, public opinion and calls for other similar votes elsewhere speak to a disconnect between other European populations and the organisation. A Pew Research Centre survey published in early June of over 10,000 people showed significant opposition among EU citizens for further European integration.</span></span></p>&#13;\n<p><span><span>In France \u2013 one of the founding members of the EU \u2013 61% of respondents held an unfavourable opinion. Several other EU member countries, including Greece, Spain and Germany, have also shown a significant decline in support for the regional bloc since 2014. Another survey published this month by the Berlin-based Bertelsmann Foundation also speaks to this trend. The survey, which included 11,000 respondents, showed that French and Italian referendums on EU membership would only result in slim majorities in favour of their countries remaining within the regional bloc. </span></span></p>&#13;\n<p><span><span>Moreover, it is becoming accepted that the UK\u2019s vote to leave not only reflected disaffection with the EU itself, but also increasing anger at a political elite that had failed to improve stagnant wage growth and inequality. While many people balked at a statement by Michael Gove, a pro-exit Conservative MP, that \u201cthe people are tired of experts\u201d, 17.410,742 voters were apparently not persuaded by the arguments of what was perceived as the intellectual, economic and political establishment.</span></span></p>&#13;\n<p><span><span>Similar developments in Europe over the last year indicate that the UK population is not alone. In Spain, a significant portion of votes in the 26 June election went to a far-left anti-establishment coalition of Unidos-Podemos. Austria\u2019s far-right Freedom Party (FP\u00d6) narrowly lost the May presidential elections. Meanwhile, an Italian political party established in 2009 by a comedian in protest against political elites recently won mayoral elections in Rome.</span></span></p>&#13;\n<p><span><span>At this point, there is a cloud of uncertainty hanging over Europe. What happens now largely depends on developments within the UK over the coming months, as well as how protracted exit negotiations proceed.</span></span></p>&#13;\n<p><span><span>UK Prime Minister David Cameron has stated that he will step down by October to allow \u201cfresh leadership\u201d to navigate the UK\u2019s withdrawal from the EU. This precludes any immediate move to commence possible negotiations, let alone allow the UK to begin detangling itself from Brussels treaties and institutions by invoking Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty.</span></span></p>&#13;\n<p><span><span>The other 27 EU member states remain unsure over how to proceed with the UK, as no collective road map has been established. However, for the most part, European leaders want Britain to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty as soon as possible to prevent continued uncertainty from impacting the region\u2019s economic outlook. Initial murmurs of informal negotiations have fallen flat, with EU Parliament President Martin Schulz leading calls for the formal exit process to commence without further negotiations.</span></span></p>&#13;\n<p><span><span>The EU is also in a difficult position in terms of how to respond. The key issue at play is that if the EU allows the UK to gain further concessions in informal negotiations, then other member states will follow suit with similar demands, which would further undermine the EU\u2019s overarching integration project. Furthermore, if Britain emerges from a couple of months of economic volatility and uncertainty relatively unscathed by the initial economic shock and political instability, then other European voters will be tempted to demand their own exit referendums.</span></span></p>&#13;\n<p><span><span>Alternatively, if the Brexit vote leads to extended economic turmoil in the UK over the medium term, other EU members may be reluctant to follow the UK into the quagmire. The EU is incentivised to ensure that the UK suffers for opting out, but favouring sticks over carrots may only earn a pyrrhic victory, given how economically interconnected the UK is with the EU.</span></span></p>&#13;\n<p><span><span>Furthermore, economic fear-mongering did little to encourage UK voters to remain in the bloc, and punitive measures against the UK may be similarly ineffective in stemming the rising tide of Eurosceptism in Europe. Statements over the last few days by EU leaders in response to the Brexit vote suggest that the EU has not fully acknowledged that the referendum points to a deeper shift in terms of attitudes towards integration. European Council President Donald Tusk\u2019s statement that \u201cwhat doesn\u2019t kill you makes you stronger\u201d appears particularly worrying in this regard.</span></span></p>&#13;\n<p><span><span>In order to survive, the EU must fight to regain legitimacy in the eyes of many Europeans, rather than resting on fragile notions of the worthiness of the European project. Substantive structural and policy changes may be required to demonstrate to Europe\u2019s middle and working classes that the EU shares their concerns. Recent public opinion polls suggest that the institution needs to improve its public relations and communications with the European citizens it represents: a 2015 Eurobarometer survey showed that only 28 percent of UK citizens could answer three questions about the EU\u2019s composition and processes correctly. Furthermore, the Brexit results also call into question the EU\u2019s primary goal of an \u201cever closer union\u201d \u2013 a rigorous debate on this aim will likely be required.</span></span></p>&#13;\n<p><span><span><span>Making the relevant changes will require a great degree of organisational flexibility and agility, something a complex EU bureaucracy is likely to struggle to achieve. However, the clock is ticking. While other EU referenda are unlikely over the coming six months, the French general election, scheduled for April and May 2017, is likely to serve as a critical litmus test for the EU\u2019s future; if one of the founding state\u2019s election results favour a candidate opposed to continuing the European project, the EU may further unravel, with the all the attendant political consequences. </span></span><span><span><span><b>DM</b></span></span></span></span></p>&#13;\n<p><span><span><span><i>Photo: German Chancellor Angela Merkel (L-R), British Prime Minister David Cameron and French President Francois Hollande chat during a meeting on the sidelines of two-days European Union leaders summit in Brussels, Belgium, 18 March 2016.

He said the Hortonworks team learned Spark could benefit from some additional tools to help with data visualization and exploration to glean business insights.\n</p>&#13;\n\n&#13;\n&#13;\n<figure>\n <a href=\"~/media/ECG/adtmag/Images/2016/06/hdp25.png\" target=\"_blank\">\n    <img alt=\"The Hortonworks Data Platform\" src=\"~/media/ECG/adtmag/Images/2016/06/hdp25_s.png\"/></a>\n <figcaption>\n  <b>[Click on image for larger view.]</b>\n The Hortonworks Data Platform <em>(source: Hortonworks)</em>  </figcaption> </figure>&#13;\n\n\n&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>\"To address the ease of use of Spark through visual tools, Hortonworks began working with the team from NFLabs within the Apache Zeppelin community in 2015,\" Hall said.  \"Zeppelin addresses use cases like data exploration, data discovery, and interactive code snippets while providing built-in visualization. We believe that  Zeppelin has the potential to modern data science studio and it is particularly powerful in the context of Spark.  The work we have focused on within the community has centered around enterprise readiness with a particular focus on security.  Zeppelin now runs on a secure cluster and has basic authentication and authorization capabilities that allow it to be used within the enterprise.\"\n</p>&#13;\n\n&#13;\n&#13;\n<figure>\n <a href=\"~/media/ECG/adtmag/Images/2016/06/hdp25_new.png\" target=\"_blank\">\n    <img alt=\"What's New in HDP 2.5\" src=\"~/media/ECG/adtmag/Images/2016/06/hdp25_new_s.png\"/></a>\n <figcaption>\n  <b>[Click on image for larger view.]</b>\nWhat's New in HDP 2.5 <em>(source: Hortonworks)</em>  </figcaption> </figure>&#13;\n\n&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Under the \"developer productivity\" category, Hortonworks said the HDP 2.5 includes a new Apache Phoenix Query Server that benefits developers using Apache Phoenix with HBase. Phoenix is a relational database engine supporting OLTP for Hadoop that uses Apache HBase as its backing data store. With the addition of the query server, developers now have a broader choice of development languages to use in querying HBase.\n</p>&#13;\n\n\n&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>\"In addition, Apache Storm allows for large scale deployments with advanced capabilities to address real-time stream processing such as native heartbeat support and automatic back pressure,\" Hortonworks said. \"Further developer productivity advancements include new connectors for search and NoSQL databases.

In addition, Atlas now provides cross-component lineage.\"\n</p>&#13;\n\n\n&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Hall again provided more details. \"By integrating Atlas with Ranger enterprises can now implement dynamic classification-based security policies, in addition to role-based security,\" he said. \"Ranger's centralized platform empowers data administrators to define security policy based on Atlas metadata tags or attributes and apply this policy in real-time to the entire hierarchy of assets including databases, tables and columns, thereby preventing violations from occurring.

{"article_content_readability": "<html><body><div><td valign=\"top\">&#13;\n                &#13;\n                &#13;\n                <p>According to Forrester\u2019s \u201cCustomer Lifecycle Journey,\u201d there has been an 81 percent increase in customer use of online forums and communities for self-help, which corroborates the Edelman Trust Barometer\u2019s findings that 63 percent of global consumers say they trust \u201ca person like yourself\u201d more than a company employee (52 percent) or company CEO (49 percent). With all this strong support from customers for online communities, it\u2019s important that organizations get their customer engagement right from day one.</p><p>One of the biggest dangers in building a successful customer community is not engaging new customers within the first days, weeks, and early months. The risk is that once a customer becomes inactive or never engages in the first place, it is almost impossible to get them re-engaged. It can be a pressure-filled task\u2014we spend so much time planning how to <em>win</em> new customers, but do we spend enough time thinking about how to <em>keep</em> them once they arrive? This is where an online community can be a critical component for any new customer on-boarding program.</p><h4>Personalization</h4><p>New customers are joining your online community, and they need to get engaged right away. You should encourage interactions immediately in order to ensure customers stay interested, connected, and engaged long-term. But also make sure your interactions with new customers are balanced\u2014too much outreach can scare or overwhelm someone new, while not enough fails to capture their interest or help them see the value in your customer community.</p><p>First create a new customer campaign that includes personalized calls to action (CTAs) to engage customers. According to a HubSpot study of 93,000 CTAs, personalized CTAs convert 42 percent better. So you\u2019re halfway there with personalization. But let\u2019s be honest: You want to be personal without infringing on your customers\u2019 privacy or time. You need to keep them engaged without crossing the line<strong>.\u00a0</strong>Encourage engagement with the very first CTAs\u2014when a new customer joins, send a personalized note with details on an interesting community discussion they should join, based off of their interests. If they join a discussion early on, they will become more invested in what the community has to offer. You can also reach out and share a list of people they may know who are already participating in the community, with links to connect. These outreach tactics focus on interaction, not just static content or signing up for something. It\u2019s easy to cross the line with repetitive requests to download a new article, or successive emails asking to sign up for a newsletter over and over.</p>&#13;\n                &#13;\n<p id=\"div-gpt-ad-1385150695079-8\">&#13;\n&#13;\n</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n                <h4>Balance Is Key</h4><p>Now that you\u2019ve personalized your message, let\u2019s keep balance in mind. It\u2019s pivotal to carefully adjust parameters for your audience segments, making sure they\u2019re as specific as possible. It boils down to gathering the right information in advance. Go beyond, \u201cDo you want to receive emails? If so, check this box.\u201d Asking them for detailed feedback on how they want to interact with you will signal to them that you are a thoughtful contact.</p><p>So be sure you\u2019re gathering the right data through your automated campaigns, and present multiple ways for your customers to interact with you, based on their own desires. You\u2019ve heard it before but it resonates here: It\u2019s about getting the right message to the right person at the right time.</p><p>Implementing automated campaigns early can have two-pronged success: You gather data about what your customers want and need, and your customers have timely opportunities to engage and see what interests them. Integrating this type of automation with an online community means you can put that useful data to work and offer an authentic engagement space for your customers.</p><p>Why is it worth the effort? Because engaged customers refer new customers, provide you with ongoing valuable feedback, and spend more!

With all this strong support from customers for online communities, it\u2019s important that organizations get their customer engagement right from day one. One of the biggest dangers in building a successful customer community is not engaging new customers within the first days, weeks, and early months. The risk is that once a customer becomes inactive or never engages in the first place, it is almost impossible to get them re-engaged. It can be a pressure-filled task\u2014we spend so much time planning how to win new customers, but do we spend enough time thinking about how to keep them once they arrive? This is where an online community can be a critical component for any new customer on-boarding program. New customers are joining your online community, and they need to get engaged right away. You should encourage interactions immediately in order to ensure customers stay interested, connected, and engaged long-term. But also make sure your interactions with new customers are balanced\u2014too much outreach can scare or overwhelm someone new, while not enough fails to capture their interest or help them see the value in your customer community. First create a new customer campaign that includes personalized calls to action (CTAs) to engage customers. According to a HubSpot study of 93,000 CTAs, personalized CTAs convert 42 percent better. So you\u2019re halfway there with personalization. But let\u2019s be honest: You want to be personal without infringing on your customers\u2019 privacy or time. You need to keep them engaged without crossing the line.\u00a0Encourage engagement with the very first CTAs\u2014when a new customer joins, send a personalized note with details on an interesting community discussion they should join, based off of their interests. If they join a discussion early on, they will become more invested in what the community has to offer. You can also reach out and share a list of people they may know who are already participating in the community, with links to connect. These outreach tactics focus on interaction, not just static content or signing up for something. It\u2019s easy to cross the line with repetitive requests to download a new article, or successive emails asking to sign up for a newsletter over and over. Now that you\u2019ve personalized your message, let\u2019s keep balance in mind. It\u2019s pivotal to carefully adjust parameters for your audience segments, making sure they\u2019re as specific as possible. It boils down to gathering the right information in advance. Go beyond, \u201cDo you want to receive emails? If so, check this box.\u201d Asking them for detailed feedback on how they want to interact with you will signal to them that you are a thoughtful contact. So be sure you\u2019re gathering the right data through your automated campaigns, and present multiple ways for your customers to interact with you, based on their own desires. You\u2019ve heard it before but it resonates here: It\u2019s about getting the right message to the right person at the right time. Implementing automated campaigns early can have two-pronged success: You gather data about what your customers want and need, and your customers have timely opportunities to engage and see what interests them. Integrating this type of automation with an online community means you can put that useful data to work and offer an authentic engagement space for your customers. Why is it worth the effort? Because engaged customers refer new customers, provide you with ongoing valuable feedback, and spend more! A large professional association found that its most engaged community members were 30 percent more likely to refer a friend or colleague and spent five times the amount of money as disengaged members. Most of the organization\u2019s new customer campaigns had conversion rates between 25 and 45 percent. Those are numbers any marketing professional would love.

We believe that  Zeppelin has the potential to modern data science studio and it is particularly powerful in the context of Spark.  The work we have focused on within the community has centered around enterprise readiness with a particular focus on security.  Zeppelin now runs on a secure cluster and has basic authentication and authorization capabilities that allow it to be used within the enterprise.\"\n</p>&#13;\n\n&#13;\n&#13;\n<figure>\n <a href=\"~/media/ECG/adtmag/Images/2016/06/hdp25_new.png\" target=\"_blank\">\n    <img alt=\"What's New in HDP 2.5\" src=\"~/media/ECG/adtmag/Images/2016/06/hdp25_new_s.png\"/></a>\n <figcaption>\n  <b>[Click on image for larger view.]</b>\nWhat's New in HDP 2.5 <em>(source: Hortonworks)</em>  </figcaption> </figure>&#13;\n\n&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Under the \"developer productivity\" category, Hortonworks said the HDP 2.5 includes a new Apache Phoenix Query Server that benefits developers using Apache Phoenix with HBase. Phoenix is a relational database engine supporting OLTP for Hadoop that uses Apache HBase as its backing data store. With the addition of the query server, developers now have a broader choice of development languages to use in querying HBase.\n</p>&#13;\n\n\n&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>\"In addition, Apache Storm allows for large scale deployments with advanced capabilities to address real-time stream processing such as native heartbeat support and automatic back pressure,\" Hortonworks said. \"Further developer productivity advancements include new connectors for search and NoSQL databases.

He said the Hortonworks team learned Spark could benefit from some additional tools to help with data visualization and exploration to glean business insights.\n\n\"To address the ease of use of Spark through visual tools, Hortonworks began working with the team from NFLabs within the Apache Zeppelin community in 2015,\" Hall said. \"Zeppelin addresses use cases like data exploration, data discovery, and interactive code snippets while providing built-in visualization. We believe that Zeppelin has the potential to modern data science studio and it is particularly powerful in the context of Spark. The work we have focused on within the community has centered around enterprise readiness with a particular focus on security. Zeppelin now runs on a secure cluster and has basic authentication and authorization capabilities that allow it to be used within the enterprise.\"\n\nUnder the \"developer productivity\" category, Hortonworks said the HDP 2.5 includes a new Apache Phoenix Query Server that benefits developers using Apache Phoenix with HBase. Phoenix is a relational database engine supporting OLTP for Hadoop that uses Apache HBase as its backing data store. With the addition of the query server, developers now have a broader choice of development languages to use in querying HBase.\n\n\"In addition, Apache Storm allows for large scale deployments with advanced capabilities to address real-time stream processing such as native heartbeat support and automatic back pressure,\" Hortonworks said. \"Further developer productivity advancements include new connectors for search and NoSQL databases. Storm also has streamlined operations for resource aware scheduling through Ambari views.\"\n\nYet more Apache components -- Apache Atlas and Apache Ranger -- provide the security and governance enhancements.\n\n\"HDP 2.5 delivers enterprise-ready features including the unique integration of industry-leading comprehensive security and trusted data governance to define and implement dynamic classification-based security policies,\" Hortonworks said. \"Enterprises can use Apache Atlas to classify and assign metadata tags, which are then enforced through Apache Ranger to enable various access policies. In addition, Atlas now provides cross-component lineage.\"\n\nHall again provided more details. \"By integrating Atlas with Ranger enterprises can now implement dynamic classification-based security policies, in addition to role-based security,\" he said. \"Ranger's centralized platform empowers data administrators to define security policy based on Atlas metadata tags or attributes and apply this policy in real-time to the entire hierarchy of assets including databases, tables and columns, thereby preventing violations from occurring. Ranger also allows for location, time, and other dynamic policies to be defined.\"\n\nIn other news released at the summit, Hortonworks: named Microsoft Azure HDInsight as its Premier Connected Data Platforms cloud solution; announced a reseller partnership with business intelligence (BI) on Hadoop specialist AtScale; expanded its Partnerworks program with new Managed Service Providers and ISV/IHV partners; and announced the formation of \"a new consortium to define and develop an open source genomics platform to accelerate genomics-based precision medicine in research and clinical care.\"\n\nThe summit, co-hosted by Yahoo, runs through Thursday."}
